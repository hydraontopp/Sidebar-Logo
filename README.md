The Personal Sidebar created by PMK &amp; Nobu is already built into the pack so merging won't be necessary. When running the rawtext title command the logo should refresh and display on the sidebar. Originally, the logo might be positioned in a way that doesn't fit your sidebar or look right, follow the below steps to change:                                                                                                                                  MANUAL CHANGES Setup is extremely easy and can be done using the following steps:  Open ../ui/hud_screen.json and scroll down to 'csc:main_logo_sidebar' (on around line 36) change elements such as the 'offset' which is set to [-10, -67] (This fit best for my sidebar but may need to be changed for your own) Another element that requires personal input may include 'size'. [70, 70] is the original I set and once again fit best for my sidebar but may need changes. Finally, open ../textures/sidebar_logo/logo and use any photo editing software necessary to edit the logo. Do NOT change any file paths but if you wish for a bigger logo image simply delete the image in the textures folder and replace with your own, making sure to name the new image 'logo'.  - Thanks for reading ;)                                                                                                                                   DOWNLOADS
